# My Arduino Projects
All the little Projects I've made for learning and practice, studying
## About

Here, I explore microcontrollers, sensors, and circuits using Arduino, ESP32, and other boards  

- All projects are **simulated on Wokwi**, so you can run them directly in your browser without physical components

- All projects are considered **small projects**
